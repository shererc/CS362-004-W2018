Assignment 4 
Description: randomtestcard1.c randomtestcard2.c randomtestadventurer.c These files randomly test the Smithy, Adventurer, and Feast cards

MAKEFILE: rules have been implemented to run randomtestcard1.out randomtestcard2.out randomtestadventurer.out.
To execute these, run "Make all randomtest[x].out" where [x] is card1,card1, or adventurer which will produce the .out files for analysis
Also note, be sure to run "make clean" between each .out file. This will prevent overlap between the tests.

Thanks,
